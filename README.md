# What you need:
(Players) A save file that has at least beaten the game once. It is okay if not all the unlockables are collected. If you get an item you have not unlocked, replace it with the appropriate item listed below:\
	-Main Weapon: HF Blade\
	-Unique Weapons, Skills, or Wigs: You simply do not gain anything, as these are all able to be completely disabled in gameplay.\
	-Cyborg Bodies: Custom Body\
Example on how this works: Say the Metal Gear Rising Player starts with the HF Long Sword, but doesn't have it unlocked in the file they are playing. In this case, since the player has no other weapons they can use, they use the HF Blade instead, since that is the default Main Weapon.\
The reason you need to have a save file that has beaten the game is so that you can access the complete Chapter select menu, so that you can play the chapters you have unlocked in any order.\

# Notes:
Logically, Monsoon in R-03 requires Ripper Mode, and Armstrong in R-07 requires Murasama.\
Logic does not consider any glitches. It also does not consider any tricks.\
Logic only requires the chapter itself for all the checks in it, but if the Wooden Sword is your only weapon, logic accounts for this, and any area that requires an object to be cut will require either a real sword, Pincer Blades, or Pole-Arm. Note that certain things can only be cut with a sword.\
If your goal is set to Complete File R-07, it is recommended that you put one or both of R-07 and Murasama as a non-local item in your YAML, since otherwise, they can both appear in your starting inventory and allow you to goal instantly.\
Sam cannot use AR vision in the level where you play as him. This makes it easier to miss chests, but if you pay attention to the locations listed in your client, you should probably be fine.
